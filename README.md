# [AwesomeQA](https://awesomeqa.carrd.co/) Docs

AwesomeQA takes away the burden of moderators and makes the knowledge of your discord server accessible to anyone.
The discord bot moves your discord knowledge to Stackoverflow, generates FAQs and provides a framework for Q&A in Discord.

## Getting started
To setup the bot you need the `Administrator` permission or must be the server owner. If you don't have the `Administrator` permission, please contact the owner of the server and ask for this permission in order to set up the bot.

### Invite the Bot
You can invite the bot by clicking [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=955744627481255976&permissions=65536&scope=bot). Please give it all permissions, otherwise it may not function properly. 

## What the bot will do
It will go through the history of messages and cluster all questions and answers using state of the art NLP models.

Furthermore, the bot will post the most important coding questions (asked at least 3 times) on Stack Overflow / Stack Exchange, so they are being indexed by Google.

## Commands reference
Coming soon:
- `/start`
    This command starts up the bot.
- `/stop`
    This command stops the bot, i.e. it will no longer read the messages or answer any questions.
- `/extract-faq <your-email>`
    Will send an email to the specific mail containing a predefined FAQ.
