# [AwesomeQA](https://home.awesomeqa.xyz) Docs

AwesomeQA answers repetitive questions, generates FAQ insights, and moves your Discord knowledge to Stackoverflow using state-of-the-art AI models.

## Getting started
To setup the bot you need the `Administrator` permission or must be the server owner. If you don't have the `Administrator` permission, please contact the owner of the server and ask for this permission in order to set up the bot.

### Invite the Bot
You can invite the bot by clicking on 'Invite bot' [here](https://home.awesomeqa.xyz). Please give it all permissions asked for, otherwise it may not function properly. 

## What the bot will do
It will go through the history of messages and cluster all questions and answers using state of the art NLP models.

Next, we will create statistics on your community's most frequent problems and curate FAQs for you.

AwesomeQA will use all previously answered questions as the initial knowledge base used to answer new questions.

You can [request your FAQs](mailto:hi@awesomeqa.xyz) and question statistics once your bot is up and running.


## Commands reference
